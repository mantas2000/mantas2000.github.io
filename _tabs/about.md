I'm a final-year BSc Computer Science student at Newcastle University. I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning new skills. I'm currently learning JavaScript, React & TensorFlow.

I'm seeking an opportunity in software development to further develop my expertise in problem-solving, coding and positively contribute to a companyâ€™s success.
