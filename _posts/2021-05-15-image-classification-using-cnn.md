## Overview
This project aims to design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10
dataset. Model over-fitting and poor performance are the main issues in designing a CNN.
To solve these problems, I conducted a list of well-thought strategies.

**Workflows used**: Git and Agile.
**Technologies used**: Python, Jupyter, TensorFlow.

**Note**: *This project was done as part of assessment for module CSC2034.*

## Task
Design and train a Convolutional Neural Network that performs as well as possible on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Results
After implementing pre-defined CNN architecture, optimisation algorithm, image data augmentation techniques and tuning general model parameters, overall model train accuracy jumped to 94%, and test accuracy reached 89%. Both train and test losses were below 0.4.

## Summary of CNN development
In this study, I performed systematic experiments to design and train a convolutional neural network.
Throughout the development of the model, I improved CNN performance and reduced overfitting with
four different strategies: by selecting pre-defined CNN architecture, optimisation algorithm,
implementing image data augmentation and tuning general training hyper-parameters such as batch
size and the number of epochs.
