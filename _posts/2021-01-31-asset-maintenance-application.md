## Overview
During this project, I worked in a team to develop an application for a company called ENGIE,
which looked on ways to simplify their assets maintaining process. Furthermore, the company
wanted to reduce its Carbon Footprint by going entirely paperless. The client required us to develop an application
that supports both Android & iOS devices.

**Workflows used**: Git and Waterfall.
**Technologies used**: Xamarin, C#, XAML, AWS, MySQL.

**Note**: *This project was done as part of assessment for module CSC2033.*

## Customer Requirements
Build an App that ENGIEâ€™s subcontractors can use that will:

1. Link with QR code or barcode to identify the specific asset that is subject to a service (QR/barcode will be linked to asset register).
2. Depending on the asset, serve up the corresponding compliance form.
3. In all cases serve up a asset condition survey form.
4. Compliance with Data Protection Act 2018.
5. Comply with ENGIE branding guidelines.

## Product Development
We decided to use the Xamarin mobile app platform to create a cross-platform mobile app that shares a native user
interface and most code between different mobile operating systems. All coding was written using C# programming language.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the application was made using XAML user interface mark-up language.
