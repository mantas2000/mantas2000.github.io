## Overview
In this project, I explored image manipulation using the Pillow Python library. Furthermore, I developed a program that modifies a selection of images of various sizes and file formats and converts them to JPEG thumbnails.

**Workflows used**: Git and Agile.
**Technologies used**: Python.

***Note**: This project was done as part of assessment for module CSC1034.*

## Objectives
- Read in image files and store them in an appropriate collection ready for modification.
- Convert the images to thumbnails and name the new files appropriately.
- Apply various filters to the images using the *ImageFilter* module.
- Modify the RGB values of images to produce a new filter.
- Experiment with the Pillow library and its modules and save what you have produced.

## Learning Outcomes
- Investigated a library’s documentation page to produce code that satisfies an objective.
- Handled the reading and writing of files.
- Explored the various applications of a library’s modules to produce different results.
- Expanded my knowledge of traversing collections to explore the different properties of an image.
- Used my understanding of a library and produced something creative.

## Investigated Libraries
- Pillow
- Tkinter
- Threading
