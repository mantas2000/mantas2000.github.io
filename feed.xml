The project was mainly focused in getting familiar with the game engine and its core logic. While doing this project I interacted with various aspects of gaming simulations, such as physics, artificial intelligence, design patterns, navigation through... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Graphical simulation of an alien planet using Unity3D engine</title><link href="https://mantas2000.github.io//posts/graphics-for-games/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Graphical simulation of an alien planet using Unity3D engine" /><published>2021-12-08T15:46:22+00:00</published> <updated>2022-03-31T17:42:50+00:00</updated> <id>https://mantas2000.github.io//posts/graphics-for-games/</id> <content src="https://mantas2000.github.io//posts/graphics-for-games/" /> <author> <name>Mantas Burcikas</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <category term="Demonstration" /> <summary> Overview During this project, I built my skills in graphics programming by creating a graphical simulation of an alien planet surface. The goal of the project was to integrate as many graphical effects as I can into the scene, while keeping the frame-rate sufficiently high to maintain an interactive experience. The specification was therefore deliberately open-ended. Cinematic scene images W... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network</title><link href="https://mantas2000.github.io//posts/image-classification-using-cnn/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network" /><published>2021-05-15T14:29:20+00:00</published> <updated>2022-03-31T17:42:20+00:00</updated> <id>https://mantas2000.github.io//posts/image-classification-using-cnn/</id> <content src="https://mantas2000.github.io//posts/image-classification-using-cnn/" /> <author> <name>Mantas Burcikas</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <category term="Demonstration" /> <summary> Overview This project aims to design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Model over-fitting and poor performance are the main issues in designing a CNN. To solve these problems, I conducted a list of well-thought strategies. CIFAR-10 Dataset Workflows used: Git and Agile. Technologies used: Python, Jupyter, TensorFlow.

Furthermore, the company wanted to reduce its Carbon Footprint by going entirely paperless. The client required us to develop an application that supports both Android &amp;amp; iOS devices.
